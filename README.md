# Introduction: 3D-Isolated-Rotor-in-Hover

This work was part of the course 'Computational Fluid Dynamics'. The purpose of this work is to perform a CFD analysis on rotorcraft blades in hovering conditions to compute various aerodynamic quantities such as pressure coefficient and sectional lift coefficient and compare them with an existing experimental literature. The motivation behind the project is to understand various fundamentals of CFD. Therefore the simulations were performed for various operating conditions including varying the collective pitch angle (CPA) and rotational speeds. The focus was on the NACA0012 profile. The outcomes were also analyzed using different numerical schemes such as JST and ROE. The study contributed valuable insights into aerodynamics of two-blade rotor in hovering conditions and advanced my understanding and applications of CFD in complex aerodynamic situations.
